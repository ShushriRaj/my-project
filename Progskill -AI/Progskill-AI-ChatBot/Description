The ProgSkill AI Chat system can easily be deployed to platforms like Vercel, Render, or Railway, where the
frontend and backend can run on separate servers while communicating via HTTPS. Security is enhanced
through environment-based configurations, CORS policies, and hidden API keys. This project serves as a
complete example of how to integrate an AI model into a real-time web application, offering a foundation
for more advanced projects such as customer support bots, educational assistants, or AI companions. It
highlights best practices in full-stack development, API integration, and modern web architecture — making
it both a practical learning experience and a strong portfolio piece.
